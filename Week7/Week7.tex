\noindent 0. With this problem I want to present a 
problem to you and ask you why the greedy algorithm fails.\\\\
Imagine we have a wizard that knows a few spells. 
Each spell has 3 attributes: Damage, cooldown time, and a cast time. \\\\
\textbf{Cooldown time:} the amount of time (t) it takes 
before being able to cast that spell again. 
A spell goes on ``cooldown" the moment it begins casting.\\\\
\textbf{Cast time:} the amount of time (t) it takes 
to use a spell. While the wizard is casting 
something another spell cannot be cast and 
it cannot be canceled. \\\\
\textit{The question is:} \textbf{How would you maximize damage 
given different sets of spells?} \\\\
It is easy to calculate the highest damage per cast 
time. But what about in situations where it is better 
to wait then to get ``stuck" casting a low damage 
spell when a much higher one is available...for example consider
the two sets of spells:\\\\\\
Spell 0. $100$ damage at a rate of $1$ second per cast with a $10$ second cooldown. \\\\
Spell 1. $10$ damage at a rate of $4$ second per cast with a $0$ second cooldown.\\\\
Optimal spell ordering $\Sigma =\{$Spell $0$, Spell $1$, Wait, Repeat$\}$\\\\
F. Given an arbitary amount of time $t$ what is the maximum amount of spells
we can cast $S$?
